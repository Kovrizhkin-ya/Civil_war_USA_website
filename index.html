		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>The American Civil War, which took place from 1861 to 1865, was a major conflict fought in the United States between the Northern states (known as the Union) and the Southern states (known as the Confederacy).</p>
		<p>The primary cause of the war was the disagreement between the North and the South over the institution of slavery. The Northern states sought to abolish slavery, while the Southern states relied on enslaved labor for their agrarian economy.</p>

	     <h2>Key Events</h2>
		<h3>1. Secession</h3>
		<p>In 1860, Abraham Lincoln, a candidate who opposed the expansion of slavery, was elected as the President of the United States. This led to the secession of several Southern states, starting with South Carolina, from the Union, as they feared that their interests would not be protected under a government led by Lincoln.</p>
		
		<h3>2. Fort Sumter</h3>
		<p>The first shots of the Civil War were fired at Fort Sumter, a federal fort in Charleston, South Carolina, on April 12, 1861. The Confederate forces attacked the fort, and after a two-day bombardment, the Union troops surrendered. This event marked the official start of the Civil War.</p>
		
		<h3>3. Emancipation Proclamation</h3>
		<p>In 1862, President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, declaring that all slaves in Confederate-held territory were to be set free. While it did not immediately end slavery, it shifted the focus of the war and made the abolition of slavery a central goal for the Union.</p>
		
		<h3>4. Gettysburg Address</h3>
		<p>In November 1863, President Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address, a speech that honored the Union soldiers who had died in the Battle of Gettysburg and emphasized the importance of preserving the Union and the principles of equality and freedom.</p>
		
		<h3>5. Appomattox Court House</h3>
		<p>The Civil War came to an end on April 9, 1865, when General Robert E. Lee of the Confederate Army surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant of the Union Army at Appomattox Court House in Virginia. This marked the beginning of the Reconstruction era.</p>
